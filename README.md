I'm from Brazil and I have been working as <b>frontend developer</b> since 2019.  
I am skilled at communicating and passionate about how to work efficiently and adapt quickly to new technologies.  
I love to make things happen. I'm regularly creating and testing new concepts here, so take our time to see my [portfolio website](https://www.guimoraes.dev/)
